Report on the mytodo app:

Challenges Faced:
Deployment Issues (Render): I initially had trouble deploying the app on Render due to a misconfiguration in the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in Django. I fixed this by updating the setting to include the correct domain for the deployed app.
Installing Dependencies: I ran into issues while installing dependencies from requirements.txt. The problem was resolved by ensuring the Python environment was correctly set up and reinstalling the necessary packages.

Solutions:
Deployment Issue: I adjusted the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in Django to match the deployed URL on Render, ensuring the app could handle requests properly.
Dependency Installation: I verified the environment and manually reinstalled the dependencies, making sure all packages were compatible with the project.

Conclusion: The mytodo app is now fully operational and live. It offers all the core features for managing tasks, enhanced with dark mode and task filtering options. The issues I faced during deployment and setup have been resolved, and the app is now accessible online for users to enjoy.
